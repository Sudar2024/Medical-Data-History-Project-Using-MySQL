# Medical-Data-History-Project-Using-MySQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL proficiency through 35 real-world queries based on a simulated Medical Data History database. It includes operations across four tables — patients, doctors, admissions, and provincename. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from healthcare data using various SQL techniques such as filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and stored procedures.
